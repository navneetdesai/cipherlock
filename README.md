# Cipherlock

Cipherlock is a humble command-line application written in C++ that provides basic user registration, login, password storage/retrieval capabilities. It uses a simple encryption algorithm (Caesar's), and file-based storage. The project was built as a personal activty to revisit C++ programming, and is in no way bug-free.
